       " Document(page_content='Machine Learning   \\n \\n \\n  6 \\n \\nMachine Learning is broadly categorized under the following headings:  \\n \\n \\nMachine learning evolved from left to right as shown in the above diagram.  \\n\\uf0b7 Initially, researchers started out with Supervised Learning. This is the case of \\nhousing price prediction discussed earlier.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 This was followed by unsupervised learning, where the machine is made to learn \\non its own without any supervision.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Scientists discovered further that it may be a good idea to reward the machine \\nwhen it does the job the expected way and there came the Reinforcement Learning.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Very soon, the data that is available these days has become so humongous that \\nthe conventional techniques developed so far failed to analyze the big data and \\nprovide us the predictions.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Thus, came the deep learning where the human brain is simulated in t he Artificial \\nNeural Networks (ANN) created in our binary computers.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 The machine now learns on its own using the high computing power and huge \\nmemory resources that are available today.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 It is now observed that Deep Learning has solved many of the previo usly unsolvable \\nproblems.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 The technique is now further advanced by giving incentives to Deep Learning \\nnetworks as awards and there finally comes Deep Reinforcement Learning.  \\n 5.

       " Document(page_content='Machine Learning   \\n \\n \\n  7 \\n \\nLet us now study  each of these categories in more detail.  \\nSupervised Learning  \\nSupervised learning is analogous to  training a child to walk. You will hold the child’s hand, \\nshow him how to take his foot forward, walk yourself for a demonstration and so on, until \\nthe child learns to walk on his own.  \\nRegression  \\nSimilarly, in the case  of supervised learning, you give concrete known examples to the \\ncomputer. You say that for given feature value x1 the output is y1, for x2 it is y2, for x3 \\nit is y3, and so on. Based on this data, you let the computer figure out an empirical \\nrelationship between x and y.  \\nOnce the machine is trained in this way  with a sufficient number of data points, now you \\nwould ask the machine to predict Y for a given X. Assuming that you know the real value \\nof Y for this given X, you will be able to deduce whether the  machine’s prediction is correct . \\nThus, you will test whether the machine has learned by using the known test data. Once \\nyou are satisfied that the machine is able to do the predictions with a desired level of \\naccuracy (say 80 to 90%) you can stop further training the machine.  \\nNow, you can safely use the machine to do the predictions on unknown data points, or ask \\nthe machine to predict Y for a given X for which you do not know the real value of Y. This \\ntraining comes under the regression that we talked ab out earlier.  \\nClassification  \\nYou may also use machine learning techniques for classification problems. In classification \\nproblems, you classify objects of similar nature in to a single group. For example, in a set \\nof 100 students say, you may like to group them into three groups based on their heights \\n- short, medium and long. Measuring the height of each student, you will place them in a \\nproper group.  \\nNow, when a new student comes in, you will put him in an appropriate group by measuring \\nhis height. By fol lowing the principles in regression training, you will train the machine to \\nclassify a student based on his feature – the height. When the machine learns how the \\ngroups are formed, it will be able to classify any unknown new student correctly. Once \\nagain, you would use the test data to verify that the machine has learned your technique \\nof classification before putting the developed model in production.  \\nSupervised Learning is where the AI really began its journey. This technique was applied \\nsuccessfully in several cases. You have used this model while doing the hand -written \\nrecognition on your machine. Several algorithms have been developed for supervised \\nlearning. You will learn about them in the following chapters . ', metadata={'source': 'machine_learning_tutorial.pdf', 'page': 10}),\n",

To arrive at the answers to such \\nquestions, you can understand that the number of data points that the machine would \\nrequire to deduce a strategy would be very large.

If a percentage of the voters were to have switched sides,  the \\noutcome of the election would have been different. There are small groups of  voters who, \\nwhen properly appealed to, will swi tch sides. These groups may not be  huge, but with such \\nclose races, they may be big enough to change the outcome of  the election. How do you \\nfind these groups of people? How do you appeal to  them with a limited budget? The answer \\nis clustering.  \\nLet us unde rstand  how it  is done.  \\n\\uf0b7 First, you collect information on people either with or without their consent: any \\nsort of information that might give some clue about what is important to them and \\nwhat will influence how they vote.  \\n \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Then you put this information into some sort of clustering algorithm.  \\n 8.

It is  like automatic classification. You can cluster almost anything, and the more \\nsimilar the items a re in the cluster, the better the  clusters are. In this chapter, we  are \\ngoing to study one type of clusteri ng algorithm called k -means.

Now group similar things \\ntogether and tell me about those groups.” The key difference from classification is that in \\nclassification  you know what you  are looking for. While that i s not the case in clustering.  \\nClustering is  sometimes called unsupervised classification because it produces the same \\nresult as classification does but without having predefined classes.  \\nNow, we are comfortable with both  supervised and unsupervised learning.
